## About this site

Hello! Welcome to my data science projects portfolio.

My name is Jaime. I am a professional in Data Science and here you will find a list of projects that I have worked related to this field.

I consider myself as a continuous learner and also, I like to share my knowledge to those who are just starting on this broad field. Data science has a vast list of applications to any kind of industry and keeps growing every day. If you have data in your hands, you can start applying data science with one simple goal: extract meaningful insights in your data.

## List of projects


[1. Business Time Series Forecasting](https://dataversenomad.github.io/forecasting/) 

In this document, you will find a business forecasting application to predict sales revenue. We focus on applying machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks & XGBoost, but we also explore tradicional (sequential) models such as ARIMA and its variants.
